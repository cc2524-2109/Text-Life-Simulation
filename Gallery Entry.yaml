  This project simulates the life progression of a character from birth to old age, 
  similar to games like BitLife and The Sims. The interface allows the user to make 
  choices at various stages of life, influencing the character’s education, career, 
  relationships, financial management and health. The user will interact with the 
  simulation through a series of menus and prompts, making decisions that shape the 
  character’s life path. The simulation will include random events and challenges that 
  the user must navigate. We might also include mini-games within the games that the 
  character can play to gain rewards (increased happiness, money, etc).
